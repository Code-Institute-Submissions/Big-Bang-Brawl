# Big-Bang-Brawl
## Introduction
This project is a simple yet entertaining implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with an exciting twist â€“ the addition of an extra element, Lizard. Inspired by the popular TV show "The Big Bang Theory," this game adds complexity and strategy to the traditional hand game, providing an enjoyable programming challenge for beginners and a fun diversion for anyone looking to engage in a quick duel of wits.
## Description
The rock paper scissors lizard Spock game is an extension of the traditional rock paper scissors game in the original game. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand, indicating either rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

However, in my extended version, I introduced one more element along the side different levels to play whether that's easy, medium or hard
* lizard: Lizard gets decapitated by scissors and eat paper, but is crushed by rock

The rules now cover all possible pairings of the five elements, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game. Players choose their move, and the winner is determined by the interactions between the chosen elements
## How to Play
1. **Choose Your Move:** Players select one of the five elements: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
  
2. **Outcome:** The winner is determined by the rules of the game. For example, if one player chooses Rock and the other chooses Scissors, Rock wins.

3. **Enjoy the Game:** Have fun exploring the interactions between the elements and mastering the strategy of the game.
## Conclusion 
Have fun and enjoy :)
